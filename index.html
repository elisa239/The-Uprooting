			  <h2>In the steps of the Syrian Diaspora</h2>
			  <p>World media attention has been gripped this year by the ongoing European refugee crisis with thousands of asylum seekers—so-called “migrants”—amassing daily at the EU’s coastal borders and traveling clandestinely through its roads and railways.  In recent weeks a shocking succession of incidents in the Mediterranean Sea and along the multiple land routes used by refugees on their northward journey has driven this summer’s death and disappearance toll to nearly 2700 and exposed the criminal recklessness of transnational networks of human smugglers.  State authorities in regions of entry and transit struggle to cope with an influx of refugees they are ill-equipped to accommodate—Germany alone is expecting upwards of 800,000 asylum seekers by the end of the year —while EU leaders squabble over quotas and policy initiatives, which are recognized to be hopelessly insufficient. Meanwhile, the political reaction of the European Right has ranged from the construction of a barbed-wire border fences in Hungary, to violent xenophobic arson against refugee shelters in Germany. In this historic movement of people—“the worst refugee crisis since World War II” as news outlets repeat ad nauseam—it has become painfully evident that a significant number of refugees are fleeing political realities so brutal they are willing to risk entire families’ lives to reach a safe haven. And they will not be stopped. </p>
			  <p>The case of Syrians displaced by war is emblematic. The Uprooting is a documentary multimedia project that aims to explore this mass, forced migration through the lived experience of its protagonists. Amid the flurry of news reports drowning the media, our purpose is to go beyond the daily headlines in an in-depth examination of the traumas of war, the nostalgia of exile, and the contours of this evolving diaspora. The project consists of interviews with a plurality of refugees in different stages of the prolonged and problematic process of migration—beginning with Syrians making arrangements to be smuggled out of Turkey and ending with people granted asylum in countries like Sweden, Germany, and France. We also intend to interview a broad spectrum of institutional and academic actors—experts and office holders that can provide analytic perspectives on the causes and dynamics shaping this crisis, and the urgent public policy challenges it poses. The Uprooting’s overall purpose is to present a collection of personal, subjective testimonies within a more comprehensive critical framework by weaving together the voices of refugees and experts. </p>
