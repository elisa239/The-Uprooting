					In the steps of the Syrian Diaspora World media attention has been gripped this year by the ongoing European refugee crisis with thousands of asylum seekers—so-called Dzmigrantsdz—amassing daily atthe EU’s coastal borders and traveling clandestinely through its roads and railways.1In recent weeks a shocking succession of incidents in the Mediterranean Sea and along the multiple land routes used by refugees on their northward journey has driven this summer’s death and disappearance toll to nearly 2700 and exposed the criminal recklessness of transnational networks of human smugglers.2 State authorities in regions of entry and transit struggle to cope with an influx of refugees they are ill-equipped to accommodate—Germany alone is expecting upwards of 800,000 asylum seekers by the end of the year3—while EU leaders squabble over quotas and policy initiatives, which are recognized to be hopelessly insufficient. Meanwhile, the political reaction of the European Right has ranged from the construction of a barbed-wire border fences in Hungary, to violent xenophobic arson against refugee shelters in Germany. In this historic movement of people—Dzthe worst refugee crisis since World War IIdz as news outlets repeat ad nauseam—it has become painfully evident that a significant number of refugees are fleeing political realities so brutal they are willing to risk entire families’ lives to reach a safe haven. And they will not be stopped.
