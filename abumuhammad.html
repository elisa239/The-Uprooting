					I left Syria on the January 27, 2012. We are from Homs and the only alternative we had back then was to leave the country. We are from Khaladye, al-Qahira street. The government forces evicted us. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					When I came to Turkey, I ended up renting a house for 7 months because I had my savings. After that I ran out of money so I went to the refugee camp with my family. At the same time I had a taxi and was working as a taxi driver. After a while the Turkish authorities started to burden the Syrian drivers with more fines and taxes, to push them out of business, because they don&#39;t want Syrian taxi drivers to take the work from Turkish taxi drivers. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					When I first came to Turkey I had 18,000 dollars with me. During the past 27 months they are all gone. In the end I had to sell my car and now I only have 1000 dollars left with me. 
				</p>
				<div class="pull-container">
					<p class="pull-quote">
						The problem with the refugee camps is that they don&#39;t give us anything for free. Now it has become a business where you have to pay for everything. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="article-text">
					When you to tell the Red Cross they are not able to do anything because the managers of the camp are corrupt. We have a shopping mall in the refugee camp and instead of selling cheap products, they started to double the prizes so they can get more money. This the second winter that I don&#39;t get any help for my children&#39;s clothes and rain boots. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					I decided to go to Germany with the last bit of money I have, because the situation in Turkey is not going to get any better, and we are not able to live here. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					I have four children, three girls, one boy and my wife. I haven&#39;t seen the rest of  family in four years and a half, we only speak on WhatsApp.

				<p class="article-text">
					I feel that I&#39;m not related to Syria anymore. If you want I can burn my passport in front of you. We don&#39;t need a country. We need a home. Syria is the main reason why we are here right now. This country didn&#39;t give us anything. And I&#39;m not going to be related to a country that made me suffer. 
				</p>
				<p class="pull-quote">
					We lost everything in Syria. We lost our house. We don&#39;t have anything to go back to. For the last three years, we&#39;ve been living in a tent. Do you know what it means to live in a tent? It&#39;s a tent. You don&#39;t even have a wall to lean on. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					We came to Turkey because we though the situation would be better. I really thank the Turkish government from all my heart, I appreciate everything they&#39;ve done for the Syrian people, but they&#39;re putting corrupt people in charge of the refugees. The worst thing about the refugee camps is the schools: my children have been in the school for three years and they don&#39;t even know how to write yet. My oldest girl is eleven years and she doesn&#39;t know how to write. Even her younger brother, who is ten, is also suffering from the same situation. We need a home. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text-italic">
					Aren&#39;t you worried about taking them out to sea? What if they drown?  
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					We don&#39;t have anything left to lose. Their mother and me, we have already seen it all. We are going to Europe for those children. The only thing I remember from my journey leaving Syria was my young daughter telling me that she didn&#39;t want to die. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					We don&#39;t care which city we are going to end up in. Germany, Denmark, France, Holland.  
				</p>
				<p class="article-text-italic">
					What are you taking with you? 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					Just jackets for my children because it&#39;s going to be winter soon. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text-italic">
					What did you take with you from Syria? 
				</p>
				<div class="pull-container">
					<p class="pull-quote">
						We ran away. We didn&#39;t take anything, not even our shoes. The day when we crossed to Turkey it was raining and my kids didn&#39;t have shoes. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="article-text">
					Even my car, which is the only thing I had left, I left it at the border and I waited for a month before I returned to Syria to take it. I will never forget that day. 
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					Again I really thank the Turkish government for everything they are providing to the Syrian people but all we ask is for them to let us cross to Europe because it doesn&#39;t make sense that after three years we are still guests here. Do you know what that means? If we would live in any other country we would at least have a residency permit or travel documents, but here we don&#39;t have anything. This is what we are looking for. We are looking for a home country. This is why we are here today: to ask the Turks that we don&#39;t want to drown in the sea, just to cross by land.
